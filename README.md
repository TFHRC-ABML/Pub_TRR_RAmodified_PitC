## Requirements

The analysis was conducted using Python and several external libraries. Please ensure the following versions are installed for full compatibility:

- Python 3.8.20  
- `numpy` 1.24.3  
- `scipy` 1.10.1  
- `pandas` 2.0.3  
- `matplotlib` 3.7.2  
- `scikit-learn` 1.3.0  

---

## Dataset

The dataset is provided as an Excel file, `Data.xlsx`, which contains multiple sheets corresponding to different laboratory tests and material properties:

- **RA Dosage Determination**: Contains high- and low-temperature performance grades (HTPG and LTPG) of binder blends used to determine optimized RA dosage.
- **Compaction Curves**: Gyratory compactor results showing %Gmm versus number of gyrations (three replicates per mixture).
- **Gradation Curves**: Measured and target aggregate gradations with control points for the mixtures.
- **JMF**: Job Mix Formula (JMF) details for all asphalt mixtures.
- **HTPG**: Measured HTPG of recovered binders.
- **LTPG**: S-values and m-values from BBR testing of recovered binders.
- **Glover-Rowe (G-R)**: |G*| and phase angle values at 44.7â€¯Â°C and 10â€¯rad/s used to compute the G-R parameter.
- **DENT**: Results from the DENT test, including CTOD and related outputs.
- **Extended BBR**: S-values and m-values under extended BBR test conditions.
- **IDEAL-CT**: Summary results of the IDEAL-CT test.
- **DCT**: Summary results from the DCT test (fracture energy).
- **HWTT (raw data)**: Raw rutting data from the Hamburg Wheel Tracking Test.
- **HWTT (Analysis)**: Analyzed HWTT outputs.

## Analysis Code

The analysis is organized into four Jupyter Notebooks:

- `Task01_RA_Optimization.ipynb`: Calculates the optimized RA dosage and plots relevant figures.
- `Task02_Compaction_Gradation.ipynb`: Plots compaction and gradation curves.
- `Task03_Binder_Test_Results.ipynb`: Analyzes binder test results including HTPG, LTPG, G-R, LTPG loss, and CTOD from DENT.
- `Task04_Mixture_Test_Results.ipynb`: Analyzes mixture performance from IDEAL-CT, DCT, and HWTT tests.
