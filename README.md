## Dataset ##

Data has been provided with this repository as an Excel file, called `Data.xlsx`. This file include several sheets, each for a specific test or material properties results, as follows:

* **RA Dosage Determination**: this sheet include the high- and low-temperature performance grade (HTPG and LTPG) of the binder blends which is used to determined the optimized recycling agent (RA) dosage at the mixture level. 
* **Compaction Curves**: this sheet include the gyratory compactor results in terms of calculated %Gmm as a function of number gyration for different asphalt mixtures (with three replicates).
* **Gradation Curves**: this sheet includes the measured aggregate gradation, target gradation, and couple of control points for the asphalt mixtures used in this study. 
* **JMF**: this sheet include the job mix formula (JMF) details of the asphalt mixtures used in this study.
* **HTPG**: this sheet include the measured HTPG of the recovered binders from the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **LTPG**: this sheet include the measured S-values and m-values from the BBR testing for the recovered binders from the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **Glover-Rowe (G-R)**: this sheet include the |G*| and phase angle values measured at the temperature of 44.7Â°C and loading frequency of 10 rad/s which is used to calculate the G-R parameter for the recovered binders from the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **DENT**: this sheet include the detailed outputs of the DENT test for the recovered binders from the asphalt mixtures of this study.
* **Extended BBR**: this sheet include the measured S-values vand m-values under different conditioning of extended BBR test for the recovered binders from the asphalt mixtures of this study.
* **IDEAL-CT**: this sheet include the analyzed outputs of the IDEAL-CT test for the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **DCT**: this sheet include the analyzed outputs of the DCT test (fracture energy) for the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **HWTT (raw data)**: this sheet include the raw data from the HWTT test to plot the rutting curves for the asphalt mixtures of this study. 
* **HWTT (Analysis)**: this sheet include the analyzed outputs of the HWTT test for the asphalt mixtures of this study. 


## Analysis codes ##

The analyses efforts of this study has been organized into 4 different jupyter notebooks, as follows: 

* `Task01_RA_Optimization.ipynb`: this notebook include the codes to calculate the optimized RA dosage and plot the relevant figure. 
* `Task02_Compaction_Gradation.ipynb`: this notebook include the codes to plot the compaction and gradation curves. 
* `Task03_Binder_Test_Results.ipynb`: this notebook include the analysis and plotting codes for the asphalt binder tests, including the HTPG, LTPG, G-R, LTPG loss, and DENT's CTOD parameter. 
* `Task04_Mixture_Test_Results.ipynb`: this notebook include the analysis and plotting codes for the asphalt mixture tests, including the IDEAL-CT, DCT, and HWTT tests.
